                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="text-justify">Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</p></li>

                        <li><p class="text-justify">In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team.

The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="text-justify">In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
